# 2bored2play

Tired of waiting in long server queues? Want to automate some tasks without having Minecraft open? 
Well, 2bored2play is for you!
2bored2play is built using the exciting [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) API. It allows you to host a proxy server, which will let you disconnect/reconnect to a server without losing your place. You can also run custom programmed bot scripts to automate  tasks while you are away. Multiple people can link their 2bored2player installations to build a collaborative map together, and view it in the browser.

## Installation

Clone the repository 
Create [your username].json in the root directory
Edit config.ini and change these important fields



```bash
host = [IP of server you wish to connect to]
port = [Server port]
version = [Minecraft server version]
details = [The name of  your json file created earlier].json
```

Then, just node main.js, you can type /help for a list of commands
